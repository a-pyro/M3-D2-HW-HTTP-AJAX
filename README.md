# Strive-Spotify-Clone

starting from the https://github.com/rolimcoder/StriveBuild-spotfyproject build week team project with 
https://github.com/Kravid-Z and https://github.com/alihfph :) 
trying to make it more dynamic by fetching the deezer api.
The static verion of the repo can be found here https://github.com/rolimcoder/StriveBuild-spotfyproject.
In this new version I decided to clone the static version and create a new repo from that. 
Animations comes from Animate.css: https://animate.style/ 
Api provided by https://strive.school/ built on top of the deezer open api :)
